# MVVMc
xCode template to create MVVM coordinator pattern.
the idea came along my wasted time to create new file for a controller after that a xib after that a viewmodel after that a navigator(coordinator) and at last an extension from controller for UI functions.  

### Usage
* download the MVVMC.xctemplate in this repository
* paste below code into your terminal
```bash
cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/Source
open .
```
* copy and paste the MVVMC.xctemplate file into the folder.
* After that you can use it into your xcode by create a new file and under source tap you are going to see the MVVMC template.
